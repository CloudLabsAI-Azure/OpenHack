# Challenge 3 - Search Based on Images

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Background Story

Now that you have a database to find potential issues faced by Woodgrove Retail, the next step is to build an AI service and add additional functionalities. The goal of the feature should be to allow 'search and find' of products available. It can be done by uploading a picture found by a potential customer to see if the same item is available.

## Technical Details

Using Vision Studio and Azure Machine Learning, you will be tagging a few dozen images and will be building a service to repurpose the images on the website potentially.  

Here are the [images](https://openhackguides.blob.core.windows.net/ai-openhack/images.zip) to start with.
