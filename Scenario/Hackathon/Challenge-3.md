# Challenge 3 - Search Based on Images

## Background story

Now that you have a database to find the potential issues facing the Woodgrove Retail the next step is to build a AI service to add additional functionality. The goal of the feature should be to allow for searching and finding products available by uploading a picture a potential customer finds to see if this item is potentially available.

## Technical details

Using Vision Studio and Azure Machine Learning you will be tagging a few dozen images to build out an service to potentially re-purpose on the website.  
There are the [images](https://openhackguides.blob.core.windows.net/ai-openhack/images.zip) to start with.
