* **Inventory Optimization:**
    * Implement an AI-driven system that predicts inventory needs based on historical data, seasonal trends, and real-time sales. Use Azure OpenAI for predictive modeling and Azure AI Search to provide fast, relevant search results for inventory queries.
* **Customer Engagement:**
    * Develop a personalized customer engagement system that uses Azure Vision to recognize products in customer-uploaded images and Azure Speech to facilitate voice-based queries and support.
    * Create a chatbot using Azure OpenAI and integrate Semantic Kernel to enable more sophisticated and context-aware interactions with customers. Semantic Kernel will help in understanding and processing customer inputs, generating relevant responses, and maintaining conversation context.
* **Deployment and Scalability:**
    * Host the enhanced application using Azure App Service for easy deployment and scaling. Use PromptFlow to manage the different AI models used in the platform, ensuring they are properly integrated and optimized for performance.
* **Data Management:**
    * Store and manage inventory using Azure SQL Database for relational data.
    * Store current article images and customer images in Azure Blob Storage.
    
## Expected Solution:

Each team will deliver a fully functional prototype of the Smart Inventory Management and Customer Engagement Platform. The prototype should demonstrate:
* **Effective Use of AI**: The platform should show how AI can predict inventory needs and engage customers.
* **Seamless Integration**: The solution should integrate multiple Azure services and databases to form a cohesive system, with a focus on utilizing Semantic Kernel for advanced natural language understanding and interaction.
* **Scalability**: The application should be designed with scalability in mind, using Azure's cloud capabilities.
* **Usability**: The platform should enhance the user experience for both the retail companyâ€™s staff (inventory management) and customers (engagement).
