   >**NOTE:** If the import fails then re-perform the steps to Import the Data-tier Application.

1. Once the operation completes, in the SSMS, expand **Databases > AzureAIHack > Views**, right click on **dbo.MainOrderSample**, navigate to **Script View as > SELECT To > New Query Editor Window**.

1. On the **New Query Editor Window**, copy the SQL from the **MainOrders** view to look at all 24,815 rows.

    ```
    SELECT        dbo.Orders._KEY_OrderNo, dbo.Orders._KEY_Supplier, dbo.Orders.ArticleNo, dbo.Article.A_Category, dbo.Supplier.S_Country, dbo.Customer.KEY_CustomerNo, dbo.Customer.C_MeansOfPayment, dbo.Customer.C_Fit, 
                             dbo.Orders.F_IsDefect, dbo.Orders.F_IsReturned, dbo.Orders.F_Discounts, dbo.Orders.F_VolumeDiscount, dbo.Orders.F_StudentDiscount, dbo.Orders.F_ListPrice, dbo.Customer.C_City
    FROM            dbo.Article INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Orders ON dbo.Article.ArticleNo = dbo.Orders.ArticleNo INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Customer ON dbo.Orders.CustomerNumber = dbo.Customer.CustomerNumber INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Supplier ON dbo.Orders.SupplierNumber = dbo.Supplier.SupplierNo
    ```

1. Starting from that sample query its possible to modify it to get just the important columns and also the pertinent data with the following query:

    ```
    SELECT   COUNT(dbo.Orders.F_IsReturned),   dbo.Article.A_Category
    FROM            dbo.Article INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Orders ON dbo.Article.ArticleNo = dbo.Orders.ArticleNo INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Customer ON dbo.Orders.CustomerNumber = dbo.Customer.CustomerNumber INNER JOIN
                             dbo.Supplier ON dbo.Orders.SupplierNumber = dbo.Supplier.SupplierNo
    						 WHERE dbo.Orders.F_IsReturned = 1
    						 GROUP BY dbo.Article.A_Category
    						 ORDER BY COUNT(dbo.Orders.F_IsReturned) DESC
    ```

1. This query will provide the following result and shows that the top 2 Categories that have issues are **Accessoires** and **T-Shirtshort** .

### Hints - Data Exploration

Start with these key tables: 
* Orders
* Returns
* Customers
* Products

Look for relationships between tables using foreign keys
    
### Hints - Query Help

To find return rates:

```
SELECT CustomerID, 
       COUNT(OrderID) as TotalOrders,
       COUNT(ReturnID) as TotalReturns
FROM ...
GROUP BY ...
```
